[EM] Consolidation - Finalize all linked engagements at the same time.

1. Customer Problem
Finalizing multi-entity engagements individually is slow and error-prone.

2. Customer Research
Firms want a single action to finalize all linked children with audit trails.

3. Our Solution
- Bulk finalize from parent with eligibility checks.
- Summary of blockers (e.g., pending check-outs, uncleared notes).
- One audit artifact describing which entities finalized, by whom, and when.

4. Product Metrics
- Time to finalize: -70%.
- Support tickets on missed child finalization: -80%.
