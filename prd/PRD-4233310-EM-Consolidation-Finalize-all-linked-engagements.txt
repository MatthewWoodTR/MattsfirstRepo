[Product Roadmap Item Title]
EM Consolidation: Finalize all linked engagements together

1. Customer Problem
Finalizing each child manually is tedious and error‑prone, leading to mismatched states across the tree.

2. Customer Research (paraphrased)
ADO description and firm feedback call for a coordinated finalize action across all linked children with status transparency.

3. Our Solution
- One action from parent to finalize all linked children with pre‑checks.
- Clear progress, failures, and retry guidance.
Out of scope: New approval roles. Dependencies: Roll forward, JE locks.

4. Product Metrics
- 70% reduction in time to finalize a 5‑child consolidation.
- <2% of finalize runs require manual follow‑up.
