Division enhancement: Option to hide division numbers on reports

1. Customer Problem
Some reports read poorly with division numbers shown; customers want a cleaner presentation.

2. Customer Research (paraphrased)
Firms asked for a display control to hide division prefixes/IDs while retaining meaning.

3. Our Solution
- Report option to hide division numbers but keep names/labels.
- Persist preference and reflect in exports.

4. Product Metrics
- 60% adoption for customer‑facing reports among divisional users.
- 0 increase in misinterpretation incidents post‑change.
