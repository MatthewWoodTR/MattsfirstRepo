[EM] Consolidation - Setting up child engagements

1. Customer Problem
Setting up multiple child engagements requires repeating the Add Engagement wizard many times, duplicating data entry and slowing teams.

2. Customer Research
Firms prefer creating children directly from the Consolidation setup screen with inherited defaults (type, dates, report release). Anchin called this a key friction.

3. Our Solution
- Add “Create child engagement” inline flow within Consolidation Setup.
- Inherit properties from parent; require only client and engagement name.
- Batch-create children; optionally copy account groupings from a template or sibling.
Out of scope: Reporting; JE features (covered in other epics).
Dependencies: 4237546.

4. Product Metrics
- Avg time to add a child: baseline (TBD) → target < 2 minutes.
- Errors during setup: -50%.
- Adoption: >70% of new consolidated engagements created via inline flow by 2026-06-30.
