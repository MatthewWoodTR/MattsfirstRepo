[EM] Consolidation - Improve Multi-Tier Engagement Hierarchy navigation and Setup

1. Customer Problem
Why are we building this?
Firms working on multi-tier consolidations struggle to navigate and configure complex parent/child structures efficiently. Today, setting up tiers, copying groupings, and moving between entities is time-consuming and error-prone, which slows onboarding and period-end close.

2. Customer Research
Why it matters?
- Repeated feedback from firms (Anchin, Bennett Thrasher) that multi-tier consolidation feels cumbersome in EM compared to legacy tools.
- Users want faster navigation, less context switching, and clearer mental models of tiers.
- Attached artifacts: Anchin buckets doc and roadmap image indicate multi-tier as a first-wave priority.

3. Our Solution
What are we building?
- Streamlined setup wizard for multi-tier structures, supporting up to 5+ levels.
- Single-screen hierarchical navigation with quick-switch and breadcrumbs.
- Easier propagation/copy of account groupings and engagement properties across children.
- Clear parent/child scoping for reports and JEs.
Out of scope: Changing underlying data model; reporting/JE enhancements delivered in separate epics.
Dependencies: 4233330, 4233327, 4206592 for downstream workflow value.

4. Product Metrics
How will we know?
- Time-to-setup first multi-tier structure: baseline (TBD), target -50% by 2026-06-30.
- Average clicks to switch child: baseline (TBD), target -60%.
- NPS for consolidation workflows: +10 by 2026-07-31.
Review plan: Monthly through GA; compare support ticket themes.
