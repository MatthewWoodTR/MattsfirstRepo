[EM] Consolidation - Roll Forward all linked engagements at the same time.

1. Customer Problem
Annual roll forward repeats the same steps for every child engagement.

2. Customer Research
Bulk roll-forward reduces manual work and risk for multi-tier structures.

3. Our Solution
- From the parent, roll forward all linked children with consistent settings.
- Copy forward selected properties (signoff types, groupings templates).
- Pre-flight validation and per-child results.

4. Product Metrics
- Time to prepare next period: -60%.
- Roll-forward error rate: -50%.
