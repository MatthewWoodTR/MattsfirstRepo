[Product Roadmap Item Title]
EM Consolidation: Roll forward all linked engagements

1. Customer Problem
Rolling forward child by child is slow and introduces drift in configurations.

2. Customer Research (paraphrased)
Requested parity with finalize‑all; ensure grouped settings copy forward consistently.

3. Our Solution
- Parent‑level roll forward for all linked children with preview of changes.
- Post‑run validation and error handling per child.

4. Product Metrics
- 60% reduction in time to roll forward a 5‑child consolidation.
- <5% variance in expected vs actual copied settings.
