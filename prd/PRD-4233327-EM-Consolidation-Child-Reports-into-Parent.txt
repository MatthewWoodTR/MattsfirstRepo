[EM] Consolidation - Generate reports for child engagement's and insert into the parent engagement

1. Customer Problem
Teams cannot easily generate a report scoped to a child and insert it into the parent binder without manual steps.

2. Customer Research
Requested by multiple firms; matches legacy workflows (CSA, PFX). Screenshot artifacts highlight desire for division/child-per-column reporting.

3. Our Solution
- Add Child scope to reporting filters and to balance columns.
- Insert generated report directly into parent’s Workpapers tab.
- Support selection of grandchild in multi-tier.
Out of scope: Tax export by division (handled separately).

4. Product Metrics
- Time to produce child-only report in parent: -60%.
- Report insertion adoption: >75% of consolidated engagements.
