Add last edit date / modified date for documents as a workpapers column

1. Customer Problem
Reviewers lack a quick way to see what changed recently without opening each workpaper.

2. Customer Research
Common request across firms; called out by Anchin as an efficiency gap.

3. Our Solution
- Add Last Modified Date column to Workpapers tab; sortable and filterable.
- Include who modified last and a quick link to history.
Out of scope: Full character-level audit trail.

4. Product Metrics
- Reviewer time to find recent changes: -50%.
- Usage: column enabled by default views in >70% of engagements after GA.
