[Product Roadmap Item Title]
Workpapers: Last modified date column

1. Customer Problem
Reviewers cannot quickly see which files changed recently; clicking into each item wastes time.

2. Customer Research (paraphrased)
Multiple firms requested a last‑modified column on the Workpapers tab to improve auditability and review flow.

3. Our Solution
- Add sortable “Last modified date” column sourced from file history.
- Ensure parity across web and add‑in views.

4. Product Metrics
- 30% reduction in time to locate latest‑edited workpapers.
- 25% increase in column usage (sorting/filtering) in first 60 days.
