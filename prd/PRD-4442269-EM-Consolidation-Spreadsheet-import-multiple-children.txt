[Product Roadmap Item Title]
EM Consolidation: Spreadsheet import of multiple child engagements

1. Customer Problem
Bulk onboarding many subsidiaries is slow and inconsistent when done one at a time.

2. Customer Research (paraphrased)
Firms want a single spreadsheet to define multiple children and load them at once. ADO notes call for column mapping and reuse of defaults.

3. Our Solution
- Upload sheet with child rows; validate; create all children.
- Map required fields; apply defaults from parent; report errors inline.
Out of scope: Client creation. Dependencies: Bulk child setup.

4. Product Metrics
- 70% reduction in time to create 10 children.
- Import success rate ≥ 95% on first pass during pilot.
