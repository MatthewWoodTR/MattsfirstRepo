[EM] Consolidation - Spreadsheet import of all child engagements at once

1. Customer Problem
Importing TBs for many children is repetitive and introduces mapping inconsistencies.

2. Customer Research
Firms want a single import to create/update many children at once, with consistent mapping and validation.

3. Our Solution
- Multi-child spreadsheet template and importer.
- Validate per-child rows; partial success with clear error reports.
- Option to create missing children inline.
Dependencies: 4233330 child setup.

4. Product Metrics
- Import time per 10 children: target < 15 minutes.
- Mapping errors per import: -50%.
