\b Product Roadmap Item Title\b0\par
Division enhancement: Limit journal entries to a single division\par
\par
\b 1. Customer Problem\b0\par
Teams need to restrict a JE to a division without repeating division codes on every line.\par
\par
\b 2. Customer Research (paraphrased)\b0\par
Requested quick win to improve accuracy and speed in divisional workflows. ADO categorizes as small.\par
\par
\b 3. Our Solution\b0\par
- JE header scope = selected division; defaults lines to that division.\par
- Validation prevents cross-division drift unless explicitly overridden.\par
\par
\b 4. Product Metrics\b0\par
- 40% reduction in JE creation time for division-scoped entries.\par
- 50% drop in mis-scoped JE corrections.\par
\par
