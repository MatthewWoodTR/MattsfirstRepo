Note List Visibility Enhancement

1. Customer Problem
Notes are hard to review at a glance; preview text is truncated; finding cleared status is inefficient.

2. Customer Research
Anchin indicates the splitter panel alone is insufficient; parity with PFX preview and print flows is desired.

3. Our Solution
- Expand preview text (row expansion/wrap) across Notes list, Workpapers tab panel, and new add-in.
- Respect line breaks; provide clearer cleared indicators.
- Optional per-note quick actions.

4. Product Metrics
- Review time per 20 notes: -40%.
- Satisfaction with notes review (survey): +20 pts.
