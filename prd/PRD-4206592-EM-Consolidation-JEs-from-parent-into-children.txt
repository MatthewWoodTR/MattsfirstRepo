[EM] Consolidation - Make journal entries to any child engagement from within the parent

1. Customer Problem
Users must open each child to post JEs, slowing close and increasing context switching.

2. Customer Research
Anchin and others want a selector to post entries to a specific child from the parent (and filter by child when reviewing).

3. Our Solution
- From the parent, provide a Child selector on the JE entry screen.
- Respect permissions; write to the child’s ledger and roll-up accordingly.
- Views and reports filter by child and across-all.
Assumptions: Multi-tier up to 5+ levels supported; eliminating entries handled in related epics.
Dependencies: 4237546; reporting epics for end-to-end analysis.

4. Product Metrics
- Time to post multi-entity adjustments: -40%.
- Support tickets on JE traceability: -30%.
- Accuracy: no increase in posting errors.
