Division enhancement: Eliminating on divisional (scope correction from roadmap discussion)

1. Customer Problem
Divisional engagements need eliminating entries without polluting adjusted balances of individual divisions.

2. Customer Research
Requested by Anchin and others to match consolidation-style workflows within divisional structures.

3. Our Solution
- Add eliminating balance type and JE support for divisional engagements.
- Ensure eliminating entries do not affect per-division adjusted balances; only roll to totals.
- Provide JE reports by division and across-all.
