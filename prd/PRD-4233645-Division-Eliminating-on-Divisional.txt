Division enhancement: Eliminating on divisional

1. Customer Problem
Divisional reporting needs elimination behavior that doesn’t distort adjusted balances of individual divisions.

2. Customer Research (paraphrased)
Firms want an eliminating balance/JE type for divisional contexts, consolidated JE reports, and division‑scoped posting. This mirrors consolidation behaviors users expect.

3. Our Solution
- Add eliminating balance type and posting rules for divisions.
- Ensure eliminations impact consolidated totals but not a division’s adjusted balance.
- Reporting clearly shows eliminations and effects.

4. Product Metrics
- 80% of divisional consolidations use eliminating type after 90 days.
- 0 unresolved discrepancies in adjusted balance due to eliminations in pilot.
