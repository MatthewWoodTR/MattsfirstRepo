Division enhancement: Eliminating Balance Type and Journal Entries

1. Customer Problem
Without a proper eliminating type, divisional adjusted balances can be skewed and workflows are confusing.

2. Customer Research (paraphrased)
Grant Thornton/Anchin want divisional eliminations that behave like consolidation eliminations and cleaner reporting across divisions.

3. Our Solution
- Introduce eliminating balance type and JE type for divisional engagements.
- Update posting, totals, and reporting logic accordingly.

4. Product Metrics
- 0 regressions in adjusted balance for pilot engagements.
- 25% reduction in time to reconcile eliminations.
