Division enhancement: Eliminating Balance Type and Journal Entries for Divisional Engagements

1. Customer Problem
Divisional structures lack an eliminating balance type, limiting parity with consolidations.

2. Customer Research
Captured in artifacts; essential to produce elimination-adjusted totals while preserving per-division views.

3. Our Solution
- New balance type: Eliminating (division-level behavior).
- Posting rules so eliminations do not change per-division adjusted balances.
- Updated trial balance and reporting to reflect eliminations.

4. Product Metrics
- Cycle time to create elimination packages: -40%.
- Support tickets referencing elimination workarounds: -60%.
