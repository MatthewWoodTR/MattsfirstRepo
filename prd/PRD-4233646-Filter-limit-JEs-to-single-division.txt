[Product Roadmap Item Title]
Division enhancement: Limit journal entries to a single division

1. Customer Problem
Teams need to restrict a JE to a division without repeating division codes on every line.

2. Customer Research (paraphrased)
Requested quick win to improve accuracy and speed in divisional workflows. ADO categorizes as small.

3. Our Solution
- JE header scope = selected division; defaults lines to that division.
- Validation prevents cross‑division drift unless explicitly overridden.

4. Product Metrics
- 40% reduction in JE creation time for division‑scoped entries.
- 50% drop in mis‑scoped JE corrections.
