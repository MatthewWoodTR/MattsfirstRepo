Division enhancement: Allow the user to filter / limit journal entries to a single division

1. Customer Problem
Posting and reviewing across many divisions creates noise; users need simple scoping.

2. Customer Research
Spec in Table 1 and roadmap image (June items).

3. Our Solution
- Add division selector when creating JEs; default to current context.
- Views and reports automatically filter by chosen division with option to see all.

4. Product Metrics
- Time to post division-scoped JEs: -50%.
- Error rate from wrong-division postings: -70%.
