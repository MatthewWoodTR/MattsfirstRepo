[Product Roadmap Item Title]
Financial Document Formula Drill‑Down (Excel/Word)

1. Customer Problem
Auditors and reviewers need to understand what composes a reported number without leaving the document. Today they must run separate reports, breaking flow.

2. Customer Research (paraphrased)
Multiple firms asked for right‑click/command to analyze a formula and show contributing accounts by grouping/subcode with totals reconciling to the statement value. This aligns with legacy parity.

3. Our Solution
- In Excel/Word, analyze a selected formula linked to TB/groupings.
- Show account‑level breakdown, subtotals by grouping/subcode, and a total that matches the document value; allow quick export/insert.
Out of scope: Live co‑authoring (separate program). Dependencies: TB linking APIs.

4. Product Metrics
- 50% reduction in time to validate a material figure.
- ≥ 90% of drill‑downs reconcile on first pass.
- 30% monthly active usage by target roles after 90 days.
